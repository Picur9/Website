    <h2>
    I am a self-motivated and professional candidate who has over 10 years of managerial experience. Previously, my role has been based within a fast-paced environment, allowing me to gain the capability of working under pressure effectively, whilst ensuring the guest satisfaction rate is at the highest of priorities throughout the team.
    My negotiation and liaison skills have given me the capability to ensure KPI’s are achieved and exceeded wherever possible. I’ve achieved a proven track record within enhancing operations and successfully driving organizations forward, solely contributing to achieving business objectives, whilst building and maintaining robust working relationships at all levels.
    To date I have enjoyed my career, but I’m looking to change my career path in IT which field had always interested me and gain good knowledge during my career, so I can overcome new challenges in order to further my career and skillset.
